## 🧩 Step-by-Step Investigation

## 🔍 Step 1: Find the crime scene -> SQL Code

SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder' 
  AND city = 'SQL City' 
  AND date = 20180115;
SELECT * 
FROM interview 
WHERE date = '2018-01-15' AND transcript LIKE '%gym%';
---
## 👥 Step 2: Find witnesses -> SQL
---
SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in 
WHERE check_in_date = '2018-01-09' AND check_in_time BETWEEN '07:00' AND '08:00' 
AND membership_id LIKE '48W%';
- 📌 Witness 1: Saw the suspect enter the gym. They used the check-in system.
- 📌 Witness 2: Said the killer had a Gold membership and car plate starting with "48W".
---
## 🏋️ Step 3: Track suspect via gym check-in -> SQL

SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in 
WHERE check_in_date = '2018-01-09' AND check_in_time BETWEEN '07:00' AND '08:00' 
AND membership_id LIKE '48W%';
- 📌 Narrowed down to 2 membership IDs: 48W7A, 48W9B

## 🪪 Step 4: Match membership ID to person -> SQL
---
SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_member 
WHERE membership_id IN ('48W7A', '48W9B');
- 📌 Suspect Found: 48W7A is Jeremy Bowers
---

## 📄 Step 5: Verify identity with driver's license -> SQL
---
SELECT * 
FROM person 
WHERE id = 67318;
- 📌 Lives on Franklin Ave
---

## 📞 Step 6: Review suspect's interview -> SQL
---
SELECT * 
FROM interview 
WHERE person_id = 67318;
- 📌 Jeremy confesses and mentions an accomplice who lives in SQL City and attended the SQL Symphony Concert.
---

---

## 🧍 Step 8: Find attendees from SQL City -> SQL
---
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.address_street_name
FROM person p
JOIN facebook_event_checkin f 
ON p.id = f.person_id
WHERE f.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
  AND p.city = 'SQL City';
- 📌 After narrowing down, one name stands out: Miranda Priestly
---
